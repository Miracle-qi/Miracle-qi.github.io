## Selected Projects

### Quadruped Robot

- **Stairway Climbing of Quadruped Robot**(Optimal Control)<br>
Jun. 2020–Nov. 2020
  <br>
We develop a simple yet effective framework tailored for autonomous quadrupedal stair climbing. By exploiting the prior knowledge about the staircase structure, the proposed strategy first extracts the geometric information about the staircase from the depth measurements. Then, the velocity and foothold references during stair climbing are generated via simple optimization algorithms based on the staircase information. Given these references, we use the model predictive control method to generate joint torques to complete the whole stair climbing task. Simulations in MuJoCo and real-world experiments on the real Aliengo robot demonstrate successful autonomous climbing of various staircases with different geometries.

### Rehabilitation Robot

- **sEMG-based Active Control of Rehabilitation Robot** (Force Control) <br>
Jan. 2019–Jan. 2020  <br>
In order to make people participate in rehabilitation exercise actively, I proposed a scenario which can adjust the joint torque of the upper-limb rehabilitation robot according to the amplitude of sEMG signals. [[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iSTeTxN6kQ)]



- **sEMG-based Motion Recognition** (Deep Learning) <br>
Jun. 2018–Jan. 2019 <br>
Compared with currently intricate and limited methods, the method I proposed is much simple, effective and general which processed sEMG signals like the way of processing images via Convolutional Neural Network. Results of experiments show that this method can help people effectively recognize general composite motion, such as handwriting motions and sign language motions.[[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tQSHg5Cdk8)]

### Wheeled Mobile Robot

- **Laser-SLAM based on ICP and Graph Optimization** (SLAM)<br>
 Oct. 2016–Jun. 2017
  <br>
Motivated by Cartography of Google, I established a scan-to-map Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm based on triangulation and SVD algorithm. Additionally, least square method was used to optimize graph after close-loop detection. Simulation shows that this method achieved excellent performance.
